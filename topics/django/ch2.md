## Chapter 2

Chapter 2 focuses on writing code to support the real-world models we theorized in Chapter 1. As part of Chapter 2, we'll also discuss South and basic database migrations.

### Deliverables:

* Each of the three applications will have working models.py files.
* We'll configure South and prepare an initial migration.
* We'll make a change to a model, create a migration and execute it.
