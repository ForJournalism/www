## Chapter 1

We'll start off the course with a quick description of the Django project/app structure and we'll walk through the data, breaking up an inspections project into three basic real-world model buckets. We'll talk through some of the quirks of inspection data and set up the project. Finally, we'll talk a little bit about virtualenv and the Python environment.

### Deliverables:

* A Django project called "inspections"
* Multiple apps to let us designate inspection data types and sources. These apps will have the files necessary to support a Django application: api.py, admin.py, models.py, views.py and urls.py.
* A settings.py and a global urls.py file.
* A "hello world" moment running the Django admin on localhost.
* A repository somewhere with the code in it.
